From the 19th of November to the 12th of December, a hackathon will commence
with the intention of completing as many of the outstanding issues present on
the BrainFANS repository. People will be split into 2 teams who will compete
for a grand prize.

Teams will need to claim issues on BrainFANS by assigning a member of their
team to them. After claiming an issue, the team that claims it must then create
a feature branch and work on a solution. Once complete they produce a pull
request with their solution. At this point, the other team will then review the
solution. They can either approve it as is, or make suggestions for change. The
fact that each team are reviewing each others pull requests will hopefully
result good quality working solutions being committed to the repository. An
arbiter will be available to ensure fair play, and overrule overly picky
reviews.

Teams will be awarded points for engaging in good practise and successfully
closing issues. As issues are not equal in the magnitude of changes and thus
time need to solve the score for an issue will be proportional to the number of
lines changed in the pull request. Detailed, more thorough pull requests are
hence incentivised. At the end of the hackathon, the team with the most lines
of code committed to the main branch will win.
